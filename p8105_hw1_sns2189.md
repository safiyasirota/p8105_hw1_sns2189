## Problem 1

**Creating a data frame:**

``` r
set.seed(11)

problem1_df <-
  tibble(
    vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
    vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
    vec_char = character(10),
    vec_factor = factor(x = character(10), levels = 3) 
  )
```

**Taking the mean of variables in `problem1_df`:**

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_numeric))
```

    ## [1] -0.2300625

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## [1] NA

It works to take the mean of the numeric and logical vectors. It doesnâ€™t
work to take the mean of the character or factor variables. In fact, the
warning given when trying to take the mean of a character or factor
variable states that the argument is not numeric or logical, meaning the
variables *must* be numeric or logical to calculate a mean.

**Trying to convert variables to numeric type using `as.numeric`:**

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

When we use the `as.numeric` function on the logical variable,
`vec_logical` gets converted to a binary variable where every value is
either a 0 (representing FALSE) or a 1 (representing TRUE). When we use
the `as.numeric` function on the character or factor variables, we get
NA.

When we take the mean of a logical variable, each T/F value is
automatically converted to 0 or 1, and we take the mean of this numeric
vector. We cannot compute the means of character or factor variables
because they have no numeric conversion.
