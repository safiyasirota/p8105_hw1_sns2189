## Problem 1

**Creating a data frame:**

``` r
set.seed(11)

problem1_df <-
  tibble(
    vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
    vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
    vec_char = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
    vec_factor = as.factor(x = sample(1:3, 10, replace = TRUE))
  )
```

**Taking the mean of variables in `problem1_df`:**

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_numeric))
```

    ## [1] -0.2300625

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## [1] NA

It works to take the mean of the numeric and logical vectors. It doesnâ€™t
work to take the mean of the character or factor variables. In fact, the
warning given when trying to take the mean of a character or factor
variable states that the argument is not numeric or logical, meaning the
variables *must* be numeric or logical to calculate a mean.

**Trying to convert variables to numeric type using `as.numeric`:**

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

When we use the `as.numeric` function on the logical variable,
`vec_logical` gets converted to a binary variable where every value is
either a 0 (representing FALSE) or a 1 (representing TRUE). When we use
the `as.numeric` function on the character or factor variables, we get
NA.

When we take the mean of a logical variable, each T/F value is
automatically converted to 0 or 1, and we take the mean of this numeric
vector. We cannot compute the means of character or factor variables
because they have no automatic numeric conversion.

## Problem 2

**Loading penguins dataset:**

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

**Describing `penguins`:**

-   The variables in this dataset include:

    -   **species** (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo),

    -   **island** (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen),

    -   **some body measurements** (i.e., bill\_length\_mm,
        bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, and body\_mass\_g),

    -   **sex** (female, male),

    -   and **year** (2007, 2008, 2009).

-   The dataset has 344 observations and 8 variables, which are all
    listed above.

-   The mean flipper length of penguins in this dataset is
    200.9152047 mm.

**Making a scatterplot:**

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Penguin bill and flipper length by species", 
       caption = "2 observations are omitted due to missingness")
```
